# Twitch Chat Sound
Makes an notification sound every time there is a new message on Twitch. The notification sound volume is linked to the player volume.

# Twitch Divs Remover
Remove some annoying divs that take up space in the chat field, to get more space in theater mode. The removed buttons can be restored by clicking on settings > open chat in popup.

# Twitch Latency & Speed
Adds an overlay to the player with the buffer size. It also increases the speed of the player to reach the stream.

# Twitch Rewards Manager
A mini-app to reject user-defined reward requests, either by username or badge. The remaining requests can be accepted to do the opposite.
