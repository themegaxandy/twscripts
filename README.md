# Twitch Chat Sound
Makes an audible warning every time there is a new message on Twitch. The sound warning volume is linked to the player volume.

# Twitch Divs Remover
Remove some annoying divs that take up space in the chat field, to get more space in theater mode. The removed buttons can be restored by clicking on settings > open chat in popup.

# Twitch Latency & Speed
Adds an overlay to the player with the buffer size. It also increases the speed of the player to reach the stream.
